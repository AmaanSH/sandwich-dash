This was a short game I created in 5 days for the Kindred Games Community Jam. The theme was Jam. This game involves you preparing jam sandwich orders for your animal friends.
The game also included layered audio tracks where each level is introduced as you get orders right.

# Game Description
His pals are hungry! It's up to this cat to jam things up!
